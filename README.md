Using data to drive strategic business decisions for Microsoft to make decisition to venture into the movie industry

OVERVIEW

The objective was to examine data on movies to determine why they perform the way they do and recommend the best types of movies for Microsoft’s new studio to produce. The success of James Cameron’s Avatar movies shows that choosing the right types of films can bring in good results. Historical data on films can help determine what types of films to invest in.

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

Producing profitable films is crucial for Microsoft's new studio, as it yields benefits for shareholders, employees, and customers alike. Shareholders experience increased profits, ensuring a positive return on investment. Employees are rewarded with competitive compensation, fostering job satisfaction and motivation. Additionally, customers are treated to a steady stream of high-quality films, enhancing their entertainment experience. Focusing on profitable film types is essential for Microsoft's success in the industry.


DATA UNDERSTANDING

Sources of Data
To understand the types of films the new Microsoft studio needs to produce, we first need to examine how the industry has perfomed, films that have performed well in the box office and their genres, and try to use statistical data to infer the reasons why they performed well and how that can be replicated by the studio.



Description of Data
Datasets obtained from movie box sites for this analysis. The data sets are named 'tn.movie.budgets.csv' and *bom.movie_gross.csv 

The datasets are suitable for the analysis as they provide information on the following:

Production budgets
Gross earnings (both domestic and worldwide)
Release Dates
The information helps us to understand movie performance, Movie popularity, and whether production costs and release dates influence movie performance.
